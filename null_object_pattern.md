# Null Object Pattern

* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Dja5WSZoA>
* Used anytime you have a null object being returned.
* You create an object that you return instead of null that has the exact same signature (the same properties and methods) as the object you'd already be returning from that method. It will just have default values for all these different properties and methods.
