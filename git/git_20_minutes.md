  * HEAD
* Pulling
  * git pull
    * Copies everything from the remote repository to your computer.
* Branches
  * git branch feature_a
  * git checkout feature_a
  * git checkout -b feature_a
* git merge feature_a
  * Merges all of the changes from that branch (feature_a) into the branch you currently have checked out. If there are any conflicts, git will notify you of these conflicts and let you decide what to do with them before committing the changes.
