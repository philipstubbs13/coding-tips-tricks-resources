* Programming Javascript Applications: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000262
  * Will take anyone from Novice or Advanced Beginner stages of JavaScript, and move them into Competent and potentially Proficient (based on the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition). This book easily defines JS terms like closures, hoisting and lambdas. And will enable you to, at the least, build a well-structured JS application.

* Web Form Design: Filling in the Blanks, by Luke Wroblewski – best book on form UX. Super relevant regardless of how old the examples are.

* HTML Spec – https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/ – …and how to read a spec: https://alistapart.com/article/readspec

* Accessibility Guidelines – https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/ - The international standard for operable compliance.

* Finally, there’s an approach to development called a “12factor app” (https://12factor.net/). It would be good to get familiar with these principles when building a cloud demo. This is the beginning of “DevOps”. This is essentially how developers (and their organizations) practice continuous deployment. The secret is a foundation of good testing.
