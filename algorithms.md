# Algorithms

* What is an algorithm?
* What are some examples of common computer science algorithms?
* How do you determine if one algorithm is better than another?

* An algorithm is like a recipe (a set of steps).
* A set of rules to accomplish a task.
* algorithm is a method to solve a type of problem. Examples: Binary Search Tree, Merge Sort, bubble sort. How to know what’s better?      Analyze resource usage and total time to soution

* A series of commands tied together to have the computer complete a set task.
* A simple example would be find_max() which can be found in <http://fiftyexamples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html>
* Efficiency of one algorithm vs the efficiency of another that is doing a similar task is one way to determine which may be "better".

* Use Linear Search for sorted data (going through list of users that are sorted.)
* Use Binary Search when you can't sort the array first.
* If you run into memory issues when searching on big datasets, run the following:

`node --max-old-space-size=4096 linearSearch.js`

* Insertion sort is slow: <http://delab.csd.auth.gr/courses/c_ds/insertion_bubblesort_analysis.pdf>
* Chrome’s V8 engine uses quick-sort for general arrays, and Insertion sort for arrays with fewer than 10 elements: https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/js/array.js

* Student Do: Binary Search
  * Have students research the concept of “binary search”.
  * See if they can create their own method for creating a binary search based on their reading. They may find binary searches in other programming languages—or simply abstractly, allow them to try and create a binary search on their own.
