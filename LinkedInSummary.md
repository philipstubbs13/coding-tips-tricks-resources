	Ever since I was little, I always liked building things. As a kid, I spent most of my time building legos and challenging myself  to create and design something bigger and better than the picture on the box or the instructions that came with them. Exploration and strategic thinking have been and still are a big part of who I am. My passion to explore, tinker, fidget, and figure things out on my own played a big part in why I was interested in a  career in web development from a very young age.

	I earned my bachelor's degree in Scientific and Technical Communication at the University of Minnesota in 2013. My passion for coding came when I decided to create a portfolio website for myself during my senior year. Ever since that experience, I knew I wanted to continue coding.
	
	 After 4 years of working as a technical writer in software development, I decided to follow my dream of developing and enroll in the University of Minnesota coding boot camp. Since enrolling, my passion for learning about technologies like CSS and Javascript continues to grow. My interest in how those technologies impact the design and user experience of the web is why I'm excited to begin a career in front end development.
	
	 Another passion of mine is running. When I'm not in a coffee shop working on my next coding project, you may find me running along a hiking trail in the Twin Cities.

	Hi, my name is Phil. In 2013, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in Scientific and Technical Communication with an emphasis in Information Technology and Design. 
	
	After completing my degree, I began working at Oracle as a software technical writer. In this role, I primarily focused on writing, editing, and maintaining software documentation, such as online help files, user guides, installation guides, and release notes, that Oracle customers can use to install, troubleshoot, and get started working with the software. 
	
	I currently work at Medtronic as a contract technical writer/project manager for the CRHF (Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure) business. I primarily develop and update the online help for two of Medtronic's key software applications (Paceart Optima System and Reveal LINQ Mobile Manager), which are used by healthcare professionals to manage patients and their implanted devices. I'm also working on a patient manual for a patient home monitor, which will be used to receive information from a patient's implantable and then relay that information to the patient's doctor.
	
	I'm truly passionate about my work and always enjoy the challenges of learning about new technology. I think the one critical attribute I bring to any project is the curiosity to learn about very complex tools, processes, and technological devices in a short period of time. The one thing I have enjoyed most about being a technical writer is having the opportunity to work hands-on with a product, which has allowed me to quickly grasp technical concepts and help the teams I collaborate with solve challenging problems.
	
	I am always open to new opportunities where I can use my problem solving ability and technological curiosity to transform complex information and present it in a clear, innovative manner. If you would like to chat about my experiences, you can reach me via phone at 952-454-3933.
