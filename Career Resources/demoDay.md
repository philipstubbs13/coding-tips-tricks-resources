* DEMO DAY
* Location: North Star Ballroom (second floor) at the Student Center on Campus.
* Time: 5:00pm-set up 5:30pm to 7:30 for networking and presentations
* Students presenting: Please keep in mind that the room is set up to maximize flow, not your location by an outlet. Tables are assigned and those near the walls are still not that close. Single presenters will have 3ft of space and groups will have 6ft of space. You will need to check-in at the main door for your table assignment/attendance for the evening. Business casual and smart shoes are recommended. Remember, the presentations will be "science fair" style, so you will probably give it a few times throughout the evening. For grading purposes, students are expected to be at their assigned table until 6:30pm. This means no switching tables or reassignments. Power outlets are on the walls only. No strips will be on the floor; it is a safety hazard.
* Students not presenting: Students are invited to attend whether they are presenting or not. Please remember that if you are not presenting, class comes first. Your final presentations will begin Saturday, March 12th at 10:00 am sharp. Office hours will begin at 9:15 as normal for last minute assistance.
* This event is open to the public; you are welcome to invite friends, family, and professional community members. The more the merrier!
