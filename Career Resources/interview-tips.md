# Interview Tips

* Be personable, be yourself (hopefully those aren’t mutually exclusive)
* Go on the offensive - bring a laptop and let them know that you have a project or example that you’d like to share. This has often eliminated the technical part of interviews for me.
* Remember that your are also interviewing the company, put in some extra effort to ensure that you will be happy in your new job.
* Seek out people first companies. Here’s a recent podcast on the subject that will help you to know what to look for and give you some ideas for questions to ask of the organization you are interviewing with. <https://startupcto.io/podcast/bonus-people-first-organizations-w-dave-zwieback/>
